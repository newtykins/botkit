# @newtykins/botkit

> archival notice: newt uses rust + serenity for bot development (and pretty much anything) now so this package has been abandoned!

Extensions to [@sapphire/framework](https://npm.im/@sapphire/framework) and [Discord.js](https://npm.im/discord.js)' main classes to better suit my bots, alongside some other stuff. Feel free to use it if you'd like to :]

- [npmjs](https://npm.im/@newtykins/botkit)
